# Perfection Salad

This is a great recipe my mom got from my aunt. She has made it every year for Thanksgiving. It is a family tradition for us. It can be made a day or two ahead of time, if you like. It looks just beautiful in a cut crystal bowl. Thanksgiving is not the same without it for us! We just 'gobble' it up! Chopped walnuts can be substituted for chopped pecans.
